<h1>FAQ</h1>
<div class="faqdiv">
Q: What is a ULP strike?<br>
A: A strike for the sole purpose of protesting an Unfair Labor Practice (ULP)
committed by the employer. Unfair Labor Practices are listed and defined in
Section 8 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).<br><br>
Q: What is an economic strike and how is it different than a ULP strike?<br>
A: The purpose of an economic strike is to win an economic concession from the
employer (e.g., higher wages or better working conditions). Employees who
engage in an economic strike have weaker right to (job) reinstatement.<br><br>
Q: Can I join the strike?<br>
A: Yes, if you're a non-union employee OR if you're a union employee whose union
contract (local agreement) has expired. You can join the strike even if you don ºt
belong to a Coalition union. Click here to see when your union contract expires.<br><br>
Q: Do I have to notify my manager in advance of the strike?<br>
A: Yes, as a healthcare worker, you must notify your manager at least 10 days in
advance of the strike.<br><br>
Q: Can Kaiser Permanente fire or discipline me for going on strike?<br>
A: No, Kaiser Permanente is prohibited from retaliating against you for exercising
your right to participate in a ULP strike. From the NLRB's Basic Guide to the
National Labor Relations Act (NLRA):<br>
<i>"Such [ULP] strikers can be neither discharged nor permanently replaced.
When the strike ends, unfair labor practice strikers, absent serious
misconduct on their part, are entitled to have their jobs back even if
employees hired to do their work have to be discharged. If the Board finds that
economic strikers or unfair labor practice strikers who have made an
unconditional request for reinstatement have been unlawfully denied
reinstatement by their employer, the Board may award such strikers backpay
starting at the time they should have been reinstated."</i><br><br>
Q: How much did CEO Bernard Tyson earn in 2017?<br>
A: Bernard Tyson gave himself a 60% raise, earning $16 million.
