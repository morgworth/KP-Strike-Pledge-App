      <h1>Privacy</h1>
      <p>Updated May 27, 2019</p>
      <p><b>Section 1 - What do we do with your information?</b>
      <br>We may use your email address to send you updates related to the strike.</p>
      <p><b>Section 2 - Consent</b>
      <br>When you provide us with personal information, you imply that you consent to our
      collecting it and using it for that specific reason only. If we ask for your personal
      information for a secondary reason, we will either ask you directly for your express
      consent, or provide you with an opportunity to say “no”.
      <br><br>If after you opt-in, you
      change your mind, you may withdraw your consent for us to
      contact you, for the continued collection, use or disclosure of your information, at
      any time, by contacting us at optout(at)kaiserstrike(period)org.</p>
      <p><b>Section 3 - Disclosure</b>
      <br>We will not disclose your personal information unless you violate our Terms of Service or
      we are required to do so by law.</p>
      <p><b>Section 4 - Third-Party Servics</b>
      <br>In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose
      your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services
      they provide to us. However, certain third-party service providers have their own
      privacy policies with respect to the information we are required to provide to them.
      For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can
      understand the manner in which they handle your personal information. In
      particular, remember that certain providers may be located in a different
      jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that
      involves the services of a third-party service provider, your information may
      become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or
      its facilities are located. Once you leave our website or are redirected to a third-
      party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or
      our websiteʼs Terms of Service.
      <br><br>When you click on links on our website, they may direct you away from our site.
      We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites and we encourage you
      to read their privacy statements.</p>
      <p><b>Section 5 - Security</b>
      <br>We take reasonable precautions to ensure your personal information is not
      inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, or disclosed.</p>
      <p><b>Section 6 - Age of Consent</b>
      <br>By using this site, you represent that you are at least the age of majority in your
      state, or that you are the age of majority in your state and you have given us your
      consent to allow any of your minor dependents to use this site.</p>
      <p><b>Section 7 - Changes to this Privacy Policy</b>
      <br>We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it
      frequently. Changes and clarifications will take effect immediately upon their
      posting to this page. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify
      you here that it has been updated, so that you are aware of what information we
      collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we use and/or
      disclose it.</p>
      <p><b>Questions and Contact Info</b>
      <br>If you would like us to delete any personal information we have about you, e-mail
      us at optout(at)kaiserstrike(period)org. For all other questions and concerns, e-mail us
      at inquiries(at)kaiserstrike(period)org.</p>
