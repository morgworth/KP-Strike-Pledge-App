  collecting it and using it for that specific reason only. If we ask for your personal
  information for a secondary reason, we will either ask you directly for your express
  consent, or provide you with an opportunity to say “no”.</p>
  <p class="w3-margin w3-text-grey">If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent for us to
  contact you, for the continued collection, use or disclosure of your information, at
  any time, by contacting us at optout(at)kaiserstrike(period)org.</p>
  <h4 class="w3-margin w3-text-grey">SECTION 3 - DISCLOSURE</h4>

  <h4 class="w3-margin w3-text-grey">SECTION 4 - THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</h4>
  <p class="w3-margin w3-text-grey">In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose
  your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services
  they provide to us. However, certain third-party service providers have their own
  privacy policies with respect to the information we are required to provide to them.
  For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can
  understand the manner in which they handle your personal information. In
  particular, remember that certain providers may be located in a different
  jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that
  involves the services of a third-party service provider, your information may
  become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or
  its facilities are located. Once you leave our website or are redirected to a third-
  party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or
  our websiteʼs Terms of Service.</p>

  We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites and we encourage you
  to read their privacy statements.</p>
  <h4 class="w3-margin w3-text-grey">SECTION 5 - SECURITY</h4>
  <p class="w3-margin w3-text-grey">We take reasonable precautions to ensure your personal information is not
  inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, or disclosed.</p>
  <h4 class="w3-margin w3-text-grey">SECTION 6 - AGE OF CONSENT</h4>
  <p class="w3-margin w3-text-grey">By using this site, you represent that you are at least the age of majority in your
  state, or that you are the age of majority in your state and you have given us your
  consent to allow any of your minor dependents to use this site.</p>

  frequently. Changes and clarifications will take effect immediately upon their
  posting to this page. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify
  you here that it has been updated, so that you are aware of what information we
  collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we use and/or
  disclose it.</p>
  <h4 class="w3-margin w3-text-grey">QUESTIONS AND CONTACT INFORMATION</h4>
  <p class="w3-margin w3-text-grey">If you would like us to delete any personal information we have about you, contact
  us at optout(at)kaiserstrike(period)org. For all other questions and concerns, please contact us
